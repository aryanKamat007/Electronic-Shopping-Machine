The project involved designing a shopping machine that utilizes an LCD display, a keypad, a buzzer, and other components to provide users with an interactive shopping experience.

With this machine, users can easily their selections using the keypad. The LCD display provides clear and concise feedback on the user's selections, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience. The buzzer provides audio feedback to confirm the selection.

Once the user has made all of their selections, the machine calculates the total cost of their purchases and displays it on the LCD screen. This feature not only provides convenience to the user but also ensures accurate billing and eliminates the need for manual calculation.

Throughout the project, We utilized our knowledge of embedded systems and C programming to overcome various technical challenges and deliver a fully functional shopping machine. Overall, this project allowed us to gain valuable experience in microcontroller programming and design. 

The code of the project is provided in the above shoppingMachine.c file.
